# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java I: Foundations and Syntax Basics

## Instructior

Olufisayo "Fisayo" Omojokun is the Chair of the School of Computing Instruction at Georgia Tech’s College of Computing. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in May 2006. Over the last dozen years, Fisayo has taught thousands of undergraduate and graduate students.

He has been the instructor of record for courses covering a wide range of CS topics--including theory, programming, digital logic, cyber-ethics, computer law, and more. For his teaching and curriculum development, he has received multiple honors at the College and Institute level.

Recently, his first MOOC on edX (Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java I) was recognized as one of the 100 most popular (free) online courses of 2021. Needless to say, Fisayo is moved by the democratization offered by online teaching and hopes to release MOOCs on other topics in the future.
