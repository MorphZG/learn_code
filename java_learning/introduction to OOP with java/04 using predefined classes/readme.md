# Using Predefined Classes

So far, you've learned quite a few things to help you write some pretty simple programs using primitive types. In this lesson, you’ll take things up a notch and start exploring how to use classes and their objects to help create more advanced and useful programs.  Thankfully, Java comes with a large library of helpful classes, and the internet offers a countless number to download, so you aren’t starting off with a blank slate.

For example, there are graphics based classes to help you write games or programs that visualize data.  There are also classes to help you write programs that connect to the Internet so you can upload or download data. In fact, recall from Java's history that the HotJava web browser was even written in Java. It used many of such classes.  We could go on and on and on about what’s been built with Java, but that would take pots and pots of coffee -- pun (or dad joke) intended.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to start using the predefined classes that are automatically bundled with Java. We'll focus on the String class, which is just one example. But, as you've probably learned from your previous programming experience in any language, strings are quite common and integral in programs. So, Java’s implementation of Strings as a class seems like a good place to start.

By the end of the lesson, though, you'll know how to create objects not just from the String class but from Java classes in general.  You'll also learn how to refer to these objects and interact with them by invoking their methods to accomplish something.
