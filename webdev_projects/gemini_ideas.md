  - "Start," "Pause," and "Reset" buttons control the timer.
  - When a work session ends, a 5-minute break session automatically starts.
  - The page title updates to show the time remaining.
  - A sound alert plays when a session or break is over.
- **Possible Challenges:**
  - Ensuring the timer is accurate and doesn't drift over time.
  - Allowing the user to customize the length of work and break sessions.
  - Adding a visual indicator of progress, like a circular progress bar.

### 6. Full-Stack E-commerce Product Page

- **Description:** A single-page application (SPA) for a product, featuring a dynamic product gallery, user reviews, and a shopping cart. This project requires building both a frontend and a backend API.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Full-Stack Development:** Building a REST or GraphQL API with Node.js (Express/FastAPI) and a frontend with a framework like React, Vue, or Svelte.
  - **Database Management:** Using a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store product information, user accounts, and reviews.
  - **User Authentication:** Implementing user registration and login (e.g., using JWT or sessions) to allow users to leave reviews.
  - **State Management:** Managing complex application state (e.g., cart contents, user session) using a dedicated library like Redux, Vuex, or Zustand.
  - **API Design:** Creating well-structured API endpoints for fetching products, submitting reviews, and managing the cart.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
