# Markdown to HTML converter

**Key concepts:**

- String parsing
- Regular expressions
- file i/o
- HTML generation

Build a tool that takes Markdown formatted text as input and converts it into basic HTML. This project entails building a tool that parses markdown source text, identifying structre and inline elements. Implement logic to recognize patterns for elements like headers, paragraphs, lists, bold and italic text. You will then generate the corresponding basic HTML tags, transforming the input structure into standard web markup.

This is a solid intermediate challenge offering practice in textg parsing, state management, handling syntax rules and output generation, making it a great exercise in structured text processing. **(Hint! Regular expressions are your best friend here)**

For additional challenge try to support more complex markdown features like code blocks, lists or tables.
