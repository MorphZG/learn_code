# Learn bash by building a boilerplate

The terminal allows you to send text commands to your computer that can manipulate the file system, run programs, automate tasks, and much more. In this 170-lesson course, you will learn terminal commands by creating a website boilerplate using only the command line.

## My notes

Course started by loading a VS code and linux environment inside the web browser. I got simple instructions to use basic bash commands and navigate around provided folder structure. After learning how to navigate the terminal i had to create "website" directory with the files like index.html, styles.css, index.js and so on. Very simple and very basic. Have nothing more to add except this readme.md file. Perfect command line introduction for complete beginners.
