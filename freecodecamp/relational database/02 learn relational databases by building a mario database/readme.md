# Learn relational databases by building a Mario database

A relational database organizes data into tables that are linked together through relationships.
In this 165-lesson course, you will learn the basics of a relational database by creating a PostgreSQL database filled with video game characters.

## My notes

Course starts with command `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres` that starts the postgres shell. Type `\l` to list created databases and create new database with `CREATE DATABASE database_name`. I did not plan to write verbose readme even though i easily could. I will instead list important statements and add few notes i found good to know. All of this is absolute basics but as organized and persistent learner i must take notes.

### Basic datatypes

- One of common data types is `VARCHAR`, it's a short string of characters. You need to declare the maximum length `VARCHAR(30)`
- `TEXT` is a variable-length data type that can store long character strings. `TEXT` can hold up to 2,147,483,647 bytes of data. The actual storage used depends on the length of the character string
- `SERIAL` datatype will make your column an `INTEGER` with a `NOT NULL` constraint and automatically increment the integer when a new row is added. Memory size of 4 bytes (range: 1 to 2,147,483,647); `SMALLSERIAL` with memory size of 2 bytes (range: 1 to 32,767); `BIGSERIAL` with memory size of 8 bytes (range: 1 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
- `DATE` The postgresql supports the complete set of SQL date and times data types. They are used to represent date and time values. There are `TIMESTAMP`, `TIME`, `INTERVAL` and `DATE`
- `NUMERIC(precision, scale)` can store decimal numbers. Can store 131072 digits before decimal point and 16383 after decimal point. Precision defines total number of digits, scale defines a fraction part behind decimal point. 2356.78 have precision of 6 and scale of 2. When declaring `NUMERIC` datatype we can ignore scale or both precision and scale.

### Basic concepts

- **Primary key**. It is a good practice to add a primary key to every table. A primary key is a column or a group of columns used to identify a row uniquely in a table. You define primary keys through primary key constraints. Technically, a primary key constraint is the combination of a not-null constraint and a UNIQUE constraint. A table can have one and only one primary key.
- **Foreign key**. A foreign key is a column or a group of columns in a table that reference the primary key of another table. The table that contains the foreign key is called the referencing table or child table. And the table referenced by the foreign key is called the referenced table or parent table. A table can have multiple foreign keys depending on its relationships with other tables.
- **Composite key**. Primary key composed of two or more columns. A composite key in SQL can be defined as a combination of multiple columns, and these columns are used to identify all the rows that are involved uniquely. Even though a single column canâ€™t identify any row uniquely, a combination of over one column can uniquely identify any record. In other words, the combination key can also be described as a primary key that is being created by using multiple columns. However, the data types of different columns could differ from each other. You can also combine all the foreign keys to create a composite key in SQL.
- **Junction table**. To create "many-to-many" relationship we need a junction table. Many items from one table can have relation with many items from another table. "many-to-many" relationships usually use a junction table to link two tables together, forming two "one-to-many" relationships.
- **Join command**. Join is used to combine columns from one (self-join) or more tables based on the values of the common columns between related tables. The common columns are typically the primary key columns of the first table and foreign key columns of the second table. PostgreSQL supports inner join, left join, right join, full outer join, cross join, natural join, and a special kind of join called self-join.

### Basic statements and commands

```sql

\l                                                          --list available databases

Example on how to create basic table setup, code copied from lesson "09 build bike rental shop"

```sql
CREATE TABLE bikes(
  bike_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  size INT NOT NULL,
  available BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
  );
CREATE TABLE customers(
  customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  phone VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL
  );
CREATE TABLE rentals(
  rental_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT NOT NULL,
  bike_id INT NOT NULL,
  date_rented DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  date_returned DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (bike_id) REFERENCES bikes(bike_id)
);
```
