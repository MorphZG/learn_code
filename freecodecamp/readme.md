# Freecodecamp

[Freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a great resource for learning to code. Many great courses they offer for free, well structured and organized. There is also an option to earn paid certificate on completion. Beside courses there is also a blog with daily articles that can help you grow as a developer. On their youtube channel you can find video courses separated from their official syllabus, quality videos from other people also.  

This repository will hold only freecodecamp.org official syllabus you can find on their webpage. Bellow are different certificates they offer. When you select one of the listed certificates you will see list of courses you should complete to earn the certificate if you paid for it. If you don't need a certificate or cannot afford it, you can complete the courses for free. I found some interesting courses on their youtube channel but if i ever do those i will save them in another directory named "/python_learning/random video tutorials/"
