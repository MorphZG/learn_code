## summary

In last module i was learning the basics of MongoDB through the `mongosh` shell client, and the `mongodb` native driver for Node.js. While native driver for Node.js is versatile, fast, customizable... it needs a lot of boilerplate code just to connect the database and validate the connection. Many developers use library called `Mongoose`, ODM or **Object Document Mapper**. It simplifies interaction with the MongoDB database by mapping the javascript objects to the database documents.

Instructor starts the new project `FruitsProject`. Just by it's name you can already guess it's complexity. Of course it's a simple project showing the basics of Mongoose. I will skip the project but will follow along. If i ever need help in future there is a documentation available.
