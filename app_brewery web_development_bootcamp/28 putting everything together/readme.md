# Putting everything together

## notes

- work directory: [todolist_v2](../todolist_v2/)

## summary

In module a [22 EJS](../22%20EJS/) i was working on a simple todo list, learning about templating and view engines. Without database we have only temporary data available on runtime. After learning more about MongoDB and Mongoose library i can implement data persistance and store data in a database instead of javascript arrays.

Accessing different todo lists is only possible by manually entering the endpoint in the address bar. Will customize the interface to enable the creation of new lists.

Don't forget to run MongoDB daemon before running the app.js.
