# Authentication and security

## notes

- Work directory: [secrets_app](../secrets_app/)

## summary

This module will cover different levels of security, from simple logins, creating the account, adding users to the database by saving the credentials to o'auth and social logins, hashing, cookies, encrypting passwords.... Building the authentication system from the bottom, learning the fundamentals and building upon. I am really excited for this one since cyber security was always something i wanted to learn.

Web app i will try to replicate is a [whisper.sh](https://whisper.sh). With simple and only the basic features, that way we can focus on learning the security.
