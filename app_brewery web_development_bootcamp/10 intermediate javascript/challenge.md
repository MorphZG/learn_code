# This is a Difficult Challenge 

Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video goes into more detail.  

This is how to work out whether if a particular year is a leap year:  
A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4 ;  
**except** if that year is also evenly divisible by 100;  
**unless** that year is also evenly divisible by 400.  



e.g. Is the year 2000 a leap year?:
2000 ÷ 4 = 500 (Leap)
2000 ÷ 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
2000 ÷ 400 = 5 (Leap!)

So the year 2000 is a leap year.
But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:
2100 ÷ 4 = 525 (Leap)
2100 ÷ 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
2100 ÷ 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

**Warning** your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

Example Input 1: 2400
Example Output 1: Leap year.

Example Input 2: 1989
Example Output 2: Not leap year.

Hints:

- Remember that the modulo (%) operator gives you the remainder of a division. We covered this in [this lesson.](https://www.udemy.com/join/login-popup/?next=/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12371848)
- Try to visualize the rules by creating a flow chart on [draw.io](https://www.draw.io.)
