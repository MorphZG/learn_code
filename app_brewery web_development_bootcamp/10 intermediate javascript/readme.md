- Math.random(); generates sudo random float between 0 and 1 but not including 1, generated number have a 16 decimal places.
- control statements, control flow 

## summary

Learning about some other useful features like randomization and control flow. One of my first assignments is to write a random number generator. Even though `Math.random()` returns float number between 0 and 1 but not including 1. Generated number have 16 decimal places so i can easily scale it and round it as needed. The `Math.floor()` method rounds down and returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.
