## notes

- exercise file: [exercise.js](./exercise.js)
- Math.random(); generates sudo random float between 0 and 1 but not including 1, generated number have a 16 decimal places.
- control statements, control flow
- loops: while, for
- arrays and collections

## summary

Learning about some other useful features like randomization and control flow. One of my first assignments is to write a random number generator. Even though `Math.random()` returns float number between 0 and 1 but not including 1. Generated number have 16 decimal places so i can easily scale it and round it as needed. The `Math.floor()` method rounds down and returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.

When working with arrays there are some helpful methods and attributes. `push()`, `pop()`, `includes()`, `length`... check out the mozilla documentation page for more info [MDN web doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/)
