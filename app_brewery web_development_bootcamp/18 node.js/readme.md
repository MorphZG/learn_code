## summary

Node.js is javascript runtime environment that can run outside of web browser. It used primarily for servers but can be used for general purposes outside of web development. In this module we explore node documentation, npm package manager and how to import standard and external libraries into the project.

Javascript is run exclusively in a web browser through the builtin javascript engine. That means that code must be downloaded by the client before it can be run. Right? Node.js is actually the server environment, runtime that runs the javascript V8 engine outside a web browser. That means that websites can have source code on a web server, no need for a client to download everything. It improves speed by optimizing data transfer but also the security since code is hosted on a remote server instead of local hard drive.
