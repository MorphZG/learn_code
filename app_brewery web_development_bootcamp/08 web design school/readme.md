## summary

Colors affect our mood, grabs the attention and sets the overall tone of the message that design tries to convey. There are different color pallets we can choose from. Depending on the position on the color wheel we can have complimentary colors, analogues colors, monochromatic, triad, square, compound, split colors...

Main font families are serif, sans-serif, cursive. Try to use not more than 2 fonts, combine similar moods and similar time era. Create the interest with contrast and weights.

Manage attention with effective user interface. Define hierarchy, add importance to different elements by using color, sizing and weight. Think about layout and positioning. Long blocks of text should not stretch to wide. When aligning the different parts try to minimize the number of alignment points, especially with text. Use the whitespace. Design for your audience.

User experience. While design works on good look and leads the users to make some action, user experience is trying to make it work, keep it simple and usable. Keep design simple and consistent. Think about multiple platforms so design works on different viewports. Share your design with different users and listen the feedback.

Don't use your powers for evil! So called dark patterns will influence the user to perform the action that will benefit the company but it's probably not something the user wanted to do.
