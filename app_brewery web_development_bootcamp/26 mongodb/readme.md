Follow simple installation instructions at [official web page](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) than start the daemon by running `sudo systemctl start mongod`. You can stop it by running `stop` command. As alternative to local instance it is possible to create free cloud service called [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com). With server daemon active i will download and run `mongosh`, CLI client for mongodb.
