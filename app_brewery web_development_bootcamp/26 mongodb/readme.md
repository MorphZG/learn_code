## summary

Follow simple installation instructions at [official web page](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) than start the daemon by running `sudo systemctl start mongod`.

With server daemon active i will download and run `mongosh`, CLI client for mongodb. Official documentation is very well written with excellent design, check it out to learn more: [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/). There is also a learning area [learn.mongodb.com](https://learn.mongodb.com/) with amazing resources.

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (binary JSON). It is a **document-oriented database**, which means data is stored in flexible, schema-less documents instead of tables with fixed schemas. MongoDB is designed to scale horizontaly by sharding data across multiple servers.
