## summary

Create a web page with h1 title saying "Refresh me". Below are 2 large dice images, one for player 1 and second for player 2. When we refresh the page both dices will roll the random score, player with higher score wins. h1 title will change the content from "Refresh me" to "Player x Wins!". No need for fancy animations. Just show the final result. I have got the starting resources. 6 images of classic red, 6 sided dice, image for each possible roll. Starting .html and .css files with complete structure and style so my only focus should be javascript. My idea was to ignore these and write everything from scratch as an extra experience but after viewing the page i see there is not much to learn, it is very simple and minimalistic so better go straight to javascript. Will maybe play with a style if i find it fun.

I had a fun time completing this challenge. Maybe because it is my first javascript project. It was definitely on the easy side but i was still playing around thinking how to realize it. I wanted more verbose code to make it easier to understand for someone who is just starting out.
