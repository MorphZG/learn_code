To reduce the archive size remove downloaded vim plugins folder and virtual
environment files for python.

    $HOME/.vim/plugged 
    $HOME/python_learning/.venv

Neovim have it's own plugin directory but it is separate from configuration.
I will not archive this folder, neovim will auto create it.
    $HOME/.local/share/nvim
