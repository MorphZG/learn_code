# Learn to code

There was first python_learning repository, than CS50 Introduction to computer science, finally after creation of SQL_learning repository i realised i should organize my knowledge base and make it easier to browse. This repository is a collection of everything i do to level up my coding skills and fuel the passion i feel for years.

Almost all files have tags at the bottom line so i can grep through them (or ack). That way i can search for important topics without complex regex patterns. All tags are written as singular (class instead of classes or loop instead of loops). Slowly adding list of modules or libraries just above the tags list.

```bash
$ grep -rnB1 "#tags.*class"

-r recursive
-n show line number
-B1 show previous 1 line (this line holds the list of modules)
```
